            <p className="info-card__info">I have been a Realtor since 2005.  I have enjoyed the past 14 years finding the perfect home for either the first time homebuyer, a family moving up, empty nesters, or the occasional investor.  I have also had the honor of being able to list and sell homes for clients as well.
Before I became interested in Real Estate, I worked in the automotive industry and owned and operated my own NAPA auto parts store in the Sacramento area. I have carried over my strong belief in customer service with me from the automotive business to Real Estate and I always try to put a great deal of effort into the sale of every home I sell.
Whether you're buying your first home or are an experienced investor, I will be with you every step of the way.
In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and spending time outdoors. Some of my favorite activities include camping and riding quads in the Nevada desert and camping by the ocean at Half Moon Bay, California.
