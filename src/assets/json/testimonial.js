        "quote": "\"In 2015 my husband and I got married and were looking to sell our respective homes and purchase a new one together. Sandy was referred to me by a mutual friend, and we immediately clicked with her friendly and professional demeanor. I was a bit worried at first that the task was too daunting for one realtor to take on, however she sold both our homes easily with no complications and they closed within a month of each other. Amazing! And, my husband and I were very picky about the house we wanted, and she showed what seemed like a hundred different homes to us and all the while, with a smile on her face and steadfast determination to find us our perfect home. Sandy helped us turn the stressful chore of selling and buying homes into a much more manageable task at hand. Thank you so much Sandy for taking such good care of us!\"",
